## FilterSearchResponse.sections property

Represents autocomplete results separated by field.

```typescript
sections: {
        label?: string;
        results: AutocompleteResult[];
    }[];
```

If sectioned is true, the matching filters will be returned in a separate section per field. By default, they are all returned in the same section.
